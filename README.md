SublimeWebSearch
================
by Ken Koch 2013 [kkoch986@gmail.com]

A sublime text 2 plugin to allow quick jumping to a web search. When the command is executed (note: a buffer must be open for the command to work), a text field will appear at the bottom of the screen. Enter something in there and hit enter and POW! web search.

## Installation

To install simply link or copy the WebSearch folder in the Packages directory (Sublime Text 2/Packages).

## Usage

The default key binding for the search event is ctrl+k (cmd+k on mac), you can change this in the *.sublime-keymap files included with this project. 
Pressing the key binding will open a drop down where you can choose a search engine from the list in the sublime settings file. If you prefer a quick search,
the default key binding is ctl+shift+super+k (super+shift+k on mac). This will open the first search engine in the settings list.
