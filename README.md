SublimeWebSearch
================

A sublime text 2 plugin to allow quick jumping to a web search. When the command is executed (note: a buffer must be open for the command to work), a text field will appear at the bottom of the screen. Enter something in there and hit enter and POW! web search.

## Installation

To install simply link or copy the WebSearch folder in the Packages directory (Sublime Text 2/Packages).

## Usage

The default key binding for the search event is ctrl+k (cmd+k on mac), you can change this in the *.sublime-keymap files included with this project. 

## Changing the search engine

In the WebSearch.sublime-settings file you can see a way to change the search engine. Simply replace the search url in the settings with the desired search url and be sure to update the search variable (for google and bing it is the letter q).

## Todo

I'd like to add a few more commands to allow quick searching of different engines. Coming Soon.
